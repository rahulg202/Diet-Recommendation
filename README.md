# Diet Recommendation System

A **Personalized Diet and Workout Recommendation System** that leverages advanced transformer-based approaches to deliver tailored diet and fitness suggestions. This system is powered by a fine-tuned **LLaMA 3-8B model with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, trained on a curated dataset of diets, nutrition, lifestyles, and health conditions. The platform ensures actionable insights for users to improve their health and fitness outcomes.

## Overview

This project addresses the lack of personalized diet and workout recommendations tailored to individual lifestyles, health conditions, and fitness goals. It combines custom dataset creation, transformer-based modeling, and an intuitive deployment framework to offer a robust solution.

---

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored diet and workout plans based on user inputs such as demographics, health conditions, and goals.
- **Advanced AI Model**: Fine-tuned **LLaMA 3-8B model** using **LoRA** for efficient training.
- **Custom Dataset**: Curated data on diets, nutrition, and lifestyles scraped from reliable sources.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Flask-based API for easy integration into web and mobile applications.

## Approach

### Traditional Machine Learning

Initially, traditional classification models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, as well as **content-based filtering**, were explored. However, due to:
- Limited availability of data on personalized diet recommendations based on lifestyle and health conditions.
- Lack of personalization capabilities in traditional models.

### Transformer-Based Approach

To overcome these challenges:
1. **Custom Dataset**: Scraped data from reliable online articles and resources on diets, health conditions, and lifestyles.
2. **Fine-tuning**: The **LLaMA 3-8B model** was fine-tuned using **LoRA** for efficient adaptation.
3. **Deployment**: Deployed using Flask for seamless integration and user interaction.

---

## Dataset

The dataset is curated by scraping the web for articles and data related to:
- Diet recommendations for specific health conditions.
- Lifestyles such as sedentary, active, and athletic.
- Nutritional needs based on demographics like age, gender, and BMI.

## Model Training

### Tools and Frameworks:
- **Model**: LLaMA 3-8B
- **Fine-Tuning Framework**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Dataset Processing**: Python, Pandas
- **Training Framework**: PyTorch, Transformers

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and structuring the scraped data.
   - Filtering relevant content for health conditions and dietary needs.
2. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - Adapted LLaMA 3-8B using LoRA to ensure efficient training with limited resources.
   - Loss optimization for accurate diet and workout predictions.
3. **Validation**:
   - Tested model accuracy with synthetic and real-world data scenarios.

---

## System Architecture

1. **Frontend**: (Optional) User Interface for input and results visualization.
2. **Backend**: Flask API serving the fine-tuned LLaMA model.
3. **Database**: For user profiles and caching results.
4. **Deployment**: Hosted on a cloud platform for scalability.
